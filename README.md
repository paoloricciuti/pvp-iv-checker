# Pvp IV checker

The new solution for checking PvP ranks, now completely open source.

This project will aim to provide:

- An user friendly front-end to check how your Pokemon ranks against others of the same species on leagues with CP cap.
- An API to use this information in your projects
- A way to save your list of favourite Pokemon to have rapid access on their rank.
- Much much more (too lazy to write out everything now, i'll eventually update this later)
